<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Building ontology has been developed to perform as the core module of the BIMERR Ontology Network, containing information related to building topology, and
components. The model is constructed as an extention of the BOT ontology that provides the vocabulary to describe the topology of a building
as well as the relationships between their main components such as zones, spaces, and building elements. The taxonomy of building components is based
on the proposed by the IFC 4.1 standard.</p>
