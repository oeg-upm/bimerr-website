<p>Figure 1 presents an overview of the classes and the properties included in the Building ontology. The ontology reuses the structure proposed in the BOT ontology to then extend
this definition to allocate new relations and attributes specific for the BIMERR project. For instance, we created the concept building:Space to add the attributes building:maxOccupants
and building:minOccupants, which are Datatype properties required by other domains to generate occupancy profiles.</p>

<p>Another important point, is the extension of the term bot:Element, which supports three main sub-classes of building elements: building:Compoent, building:Construction, and building:Layer.
A building:Component refers in general to MEP devices such as spaces heaters. The class building:Construction represents all the building elements conformed by layers such as floors, or
roofs. Finally, the building:Layer concept represents the internal layers of those construction components. A layer can be composed by several materials, where each material has a set of
physical properties, modelled by the <a href="https://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/def/material-properties/">Materials Properties Ontology</a>, which is another module of the BIMERR project.</p>

<p>Figure 2 presents an overview of the building components and construction taxonomy. This figure shows just a glimpse of the general components and materials classification tree introduced in this model.
All the subelements can be shown directly in the ontology file.</p>
