    Figure 1 presents an overview of the classes and the properties included in the Building ontology. The topological elements included in the model are:
    <code>building:Building</code>, <code>building:Storey</code>, <code>building:Apartment</code>, <code>building:Space</code>, and <code>building:Element</code>.
    Each of these elements should have an IFC Identifier that uniquely identify them in the IFC model. It is also posible to attach a 3D geometric representation
    to these entities by means of the <code>bot:hasSimple3DModel</code> relationship. The model builds around the root concept <code>building:Building</code>, 
    that incorporates attributes to indicate its physical location whether by means of a postal address (<code>building:buildingAddress</code>) or by geospatial 
    coordinates (<code>wgs84_pos:long</code>, <code>wgs84_pos:lat</code>, and <code>wgs84_pos:alt</code>). The relationships between the topological elements 
    are taken directly from BOT. A building may have several stories, which in turn may contain one or more residential apartments. In order to add more 
    expresiveness to the model, we decided to include the relationship <code>building:hasApartment</code>, sub-property of the general object 
    property <code>bot:containsZone</code>, between the concepts <code>building:Storey</code> and <code>building:Apartment</code>. An apartment has different 
    spaces such as a living room, a kitchen or bedroom, and these spaces are conformed by building components that delimit the zone itself 
    (<code>building:Door</code> or <code>building:Wall</code>) or by energy related equipments (<code>building:SpaceHeater</code> 
    or <code>building:Fan</code>).

    Another aspect of the model is the classification of elements that typically intervene in building renovation projects focused on energy efficiency. 
    Usually these elements have an impact over the energy performance of buildings. The elements classification used in this ontology
    (concepts under the super-class <code>building:Element</code> in the Figure 1) follows the structure proposed by the IFC 4.1 standard. 
    For the elements under the <code>s4bldg:DistributionDevice</code> branch we reutilized the SAREF4Building Ontology that already 
    incorporates these classes, and just added extra concepts needed for our purposes.

    Figure 2 presents an example of how to use the ontology. The building instance identified in the model as <code>data:BuildingPilot01</code> has the IFC
    idenfitier "ID001", and its 3D model its given by the file "building_pilot01.ifc". The building has two stories (<code>data:BuildingPilot01Storey01</code>
    and <code>data:BuildingPilot01Storey02</code>), where the first one has a related 3D representation called "building_pilot01_storey01.ifc" and the IFC Identifier
    "ST0001". The first storey also contains the apartment <code>data:BuildingPilot01Storey01Apartment01</code>, which includes a kitchen 
    (<code>data:Apartment01Kitchen01</code>) and a bedroom (<code>data:Apartment01Bedroom01</code>). The bedroom has a door (<code>data:Door01</code>) and
    and a space heater (<code>data:SpaceHeater01</code>).
