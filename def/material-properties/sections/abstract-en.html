<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The material properties ontology provides the vocabulary to describe physical properties related to components, materials and layer in a building context. The ontology follows the L2 level modelling strategy proposed by the W3C LBD community group for the creation of properties. The L2 level states the usage of an intermediate instance for each property which encodes both the numerical value and the unit of measure.</span>
