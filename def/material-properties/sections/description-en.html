<p>Figure 1 presents an overview of the classes, relations and attributes included in the Material Properties ontology. As the purpose of the ontology is
    the description of elements within the construction industry, we reuse the concept <code>building:Element</code> from the Building Ontology of the BIMERR
    Network. The <code>building:Element</code> class encapsulates more specific elements relevant from the energy efficiency perspective such as a doors, windows,
    or HVAC components. The Building Ontology at the same time reused the <a href="https://ontoology.linkeddata.es/publish/saref4bldg/index-en.html">SAREF4Building 
    Ontology</a> to construct this classification. The material composition of building elements follows the structure stated in IFC 4.1, where an element may have
    a construction of type <code>props:MaterialLayerSet</code>, <code>props:MaterialProfileSet</code>, or <code>props:MaterialConstituentSet</code>. An example
    of an element having a material layer set constitution is a wall, which is conformed by a set of layers. These construction types can be further decomposed into
    <code>props:MaterialLayer</code>, <code>props:MaterialProfile</code>, and <code>props:MaterialConstituent</code> respectively, where each of this entities 
    have a set of materials related.
</p>The classes mentioned before have properties and measurements related to them. For this purpose we reutilize the artifacts provided by the SAREF ontology. 
As we can see on Figure 1, a <code>saref:FeatureOfInterest</code> is related to the concepts <code>saref:Property</code> and <code>saref:Measurement</code>, by 
means of the relations <code>saref:hasProperty</code> and <code>saref:hasMeasurement</code>. Instead of making the classes of our ontology directly 
subclasses of the concept <code>saref:FeatureOfInterest</code>, we create restrictions between our classes with the saref properties. This decision 
gives more flexibility to the model at the model of representing data. For instance, an individual ofthe class <code>props:Material</code> may not have 
properties associated, so it is not an instance of the concept <code>saref:FeatureOfInterest</code>.</p>

<p>In order to provide provenance information regarding where the material property definitions, and the specific values come from, we added
    the object properties <code>props:isPropertyFromDatabase</code> and <code>props:isPropertyValueDatabase</code>. These relations point to the source 
    databases used to extract that information. Finally, even though the model allow the user to indicate the unit of measure for each measurement, 
    the databases include default units of measure for the properties. This fact is represented by the reused object property <code>om-2:commonlyHasUnit</code>.

<p>Figure 2 presents an example of how to use the ontology. A brick
identified as <code>data:BrickMasonry_01</code> has a density of 1922.0 Kg/m3. The density property is defined in
the databases BAUBOOK, ASHRAE and OKOBAUDAT, and the specific value of 1922 Kg/m3 is taken from the latter.
